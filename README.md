# Description:

Description of project: This project was to take an already developed HTML and CSS to make them more accessible by using semantic HTML and combining CSS elements that were redundant.  Also, I notated the HTML and CSS to make it easier to read and explain the certain elements that I was using. Below you will find a screenshot of the webpage along with a link to the deployed website.
